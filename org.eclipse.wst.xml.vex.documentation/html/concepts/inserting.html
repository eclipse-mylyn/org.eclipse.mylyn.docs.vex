    <h1>Inserting Elements</h1>

    <p>As you create a document, you apply structure by inserting 
    elements. You insert a new element into a Vex document by 
    positioning the caret at the desired position, clicking the right 
    mouse button, and selecting <b>Insert &gt;</b> <i>elementname</i> 
    from the context menu.</p>

    <p>Vex is aware of the DTD that specifies the structure of your 
    document, and will not allow you to insert an element that violates 
    this structure. The list of elements that are available to insert 
    are therefore dependent on the current location of the caret. 
    Similarly, Vex will not allow you to enter text where it is not 
    permitted by the DTD.</p>

    <p>If some content is selected when an element is inserted, the 
    selected content is placed within the inserted element. This is 
    handy when you have forgotten to apply an element, or when you wish 
    to rapidly enter text first and apply structure later.</p>
