    <h1>Unwrapping and Morphing</h1>
    <p>Occasionally, you may find that you wish to delete an element 
    but leave the element's content in place. Vex provides this 
    shortcut in the <i>unwrap</i> command. To unwrap an element, simply 
    place the caret within the element (but not within a sub-element of 
    that element!), click the right mouse button, and select <b>Unwrap
    </b>.</p>
    <p>A similar operation is to replace the current element with a 
    different one. In Vex this is known as <i>morphing</i>. To morph an 
    element, position the caret within the element, click the right 
    mouse button,  select <b>Morph</b>, then the name of the element to 
    which the element hsould be morphed.</p>
    <p>As when inserting elements, Vex prevents unwraps and morphs that 
    would otherwise invalidate the document structure.</p>
