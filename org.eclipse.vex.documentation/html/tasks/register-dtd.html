    <h1>Registering a DTD</h1>

    <p>You can register a new document type with Vex if you have a DTD 
    file describing the document structure.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>If necessary, <a href="create-plugin-project.html">create a 
      plug-in project</a> to contain your DTD.</li>

      <li>Copy the DTD file and any related files to a directory in the 
      plug-in project. If you copy these files outside of Eclipse, you 
      may have to refresh the workspace in Eclipse by right-clicking 
      the project in the Navigator and selecting <b>Refresh</b> from 
      the context menu.</li>

      <li>In the Navigator, right-click the DTD file and select 
      <b>Properties</b>.</li>

      <li>Select the Vex Document Type property page and provide a 
      Name, Public ID, and System ID to use for this document type. You 
      may optionally select which elements in the DTD may be used for 
      document root elements when done. Click OK when done.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>You can confirm that your DTD file was successfully registered 
    by checking out the <a href="show-configuration-view.html">Vex 
    Configuration view</a>.</p>

    <p>Note that you must also <a href="register-css.html">register a 
    CSS stylesheet</a> and bind it to your new document type before you 
    can edit documents with the type.</p>
