Contributing to Vex
===================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description:
--------------------

The Visual Editor for XML (Vex) is a set of plug-ins that provide WYSIWYM editing ability for XML files, regardless of the XML involved. Vex uses CSS stylesheets to provide the formatting for the presentation layer. All that is needed is a stylesheet and an appropriate XML file to edit. It hides the XML tags from the users, allows them to have a word processor like experience but store the information in the native XML format.

Vex is based off of a contribution from the original Vex project  created by John Krasnay and hosted at sourceforge.net. In the year 2008 this code was donated to Eclipse and has been an Eclipse Web Tools Incubator component. In 2011, the project moved under the hoods of the Mylyn Docs project.
