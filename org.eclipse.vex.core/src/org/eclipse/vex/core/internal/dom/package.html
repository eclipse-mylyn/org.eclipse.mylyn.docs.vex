    <p>Classes implementing an object model for XML documents. The 
    classes in this package are designed to be similar to those in the 
    JDOM library. However, this package is unique in that content is 
    represented by one single string of characters for the entire 
    document. Implementing the model in this way simplifies the editor 
    implementation.</p>
