		<h1>XML Security Tools Overview</h1>
		
		<p>All wizards and commands of the XML Security Tools can be accessed via the context menu which is available in
		different XML editors and views.</p>
		
		<p>You can either select exactly one XML document in the <em>Package Explorer</em> or <em>Navigator</em>. Or you can
		access all XML security functionality via the context menu in an active XML editor.</p>

      	<div style="text-align: center;">
      		<img src="images/contextmenu.png" alt="XML Security Tools context menu" width="627" height="313"/>
      		<p><em>XML Security Tools context menu</em></p>
      	</div>

		<p>The context menu always stays the same, but when you launch the <a href="tasks/sign.html">Signature</a> or 
		<a href="tasks/encrypt.html">Encryption</a> wizard via the <em>Package Explorer</em> or <em>Navigator</em> it 
		is impossible to use <em>Selection</em> as the resource to secure. This is impossible with 
		<strong>Quick Signature</strong> and <strong>Quick Encryption</strong> too.</p>
		
		<p>In order to sign or encrypt a text selection this selection has to exist before the corresponding wizard is 
		called from inside an editor. And the text selection has to be well-formed. This mens, that the start and end
		tag has to be included in the text selection. Any element content can be secured. However it is impossible to
		sign or encrypt an attribute only. In case your text selection does not match these requirements the
		<strong>Selection</strong> radio button in the wizard will be disabled. If this happens you can either exit the
		wizard and change the text selection, secure the whole document or enter/ select an XPath expression.</p>
		
		<p>Calling the <strong>Signature Wizard</strong> or the <strong>Encryption Wizard</strong> from inside an editor
		activates the Eclipse undo and redo functionality. Be aware that this can cause security concerns since it is
		easy to decrypt an XML document after encrypting it simply by using undo functionality. In case you call one of 
		the mentioned wizards via the <em>Package Explorer</em> or <em>Navigator</em> any changes by the wizard will be
		directly written into the file, without any undo and redo functionality.</p>
