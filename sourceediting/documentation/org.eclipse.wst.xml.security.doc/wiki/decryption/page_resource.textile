This is the first page of the XML Decryption Wizard. You'll have to choose the encryption you want to decrypt.

'''Encryption ID'''

An XML document can contain multiple encryptions with different encryption IDs. You do not have to decrypt them in document order. Instead, you can choose which one you want to decrypt (make sure to provide the corresponding keystore and key information, otherwise decryption will fail). However, this requires an ID for the XML encryption. Since IDs are optional you can choose to decrypt the first encrypted part in the XML document instead. In case the XML document contains multiple encryptions without IDs you'll have to decrypt them step by step. In order to avoid that always provide encryption IDs when encrypting XML data.
