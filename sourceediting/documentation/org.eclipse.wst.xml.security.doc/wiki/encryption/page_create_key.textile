= Insert a new Key in an existing Keystore =

'''Insert a new Key in an existing Keystore''' is one of the alternatives as the second wizard page. Select an existing keystore (probably one you created before with the help of the [[help/topic/org.eclipse.wst.xml.security.doc/html/encryption/page_create_keystore.html | Create a new Key and a new Keystore]] wizard) and enter the keystore password. After that simply select the desired algorithm and the algorithm size for the new key and enter a name and a password for it. Click the '''Generate''' button when you are done to create the new key. A short message informs you about the generation result and the '''Next''' button will be enabled. The key generated here will be used in the active encryption process.

Keys must be unique inside a keystore, so the wizard verifies that the entered key name does not exist in the selected keystore.

The wizard automatically stores the entered data for the keystore path and name between sessions. Passwords are never stored and have to be entered every time.
