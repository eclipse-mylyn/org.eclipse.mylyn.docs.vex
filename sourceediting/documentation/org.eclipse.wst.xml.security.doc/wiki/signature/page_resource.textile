You can either select to [[help/topic/org.eclipse.wst.xml.security.doc/html/signature/page_open_key.html | Use a key from an existing keystore]], to [[help/topic/org.eclipse.wst.xml.security.doc/html/signature/page_create_key.html | Insert a new key in an existing keystore]] or to [[help/topic/org.eclipse.wst.xml.security.doc/html/signature/page_create_keystore.html | Create a new key and a new keystore]].

In case of the XML Signature Wizard this only limits the available algorithms on the [[help/topic/org.eclipse.wst.xml.security.doc/html/signature/page_algorithms.html | Algorithms and Signature Properties]] page.
