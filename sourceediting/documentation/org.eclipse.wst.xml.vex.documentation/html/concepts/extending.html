    <h1>Extending Vex</h1>

    <p>While Vex supports common document types such as DocBook and 
    XHTML out-of-the-box, you can also extend Vex with your own DTD 
    files and CSS stylesheets.</p>

    <p>The first step to extending Vex is to 
    <a href="../tasks/create-plugin-project.html">create a plug-in 
    project</a>. Once this is done, you can copy the DTD and CSS files 
    you wish into the plug-in project. Finally, you must provide a 
    little more information to Vex by setting properties on the new DTD 
    and CSS files. Note that you must provide both a DTD and a CSS file 
    to be able to edit documents of the given type.</p>
