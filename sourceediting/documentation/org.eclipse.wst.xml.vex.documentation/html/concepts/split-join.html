    <h1>Splits and Joins</h1>
    <p>Users indicate the end of a paragraph to a word processor by 
    pressing the <b>Enter</b> key. Vex has no built-in concept of 
    paragraphs; instead, this behaviour is simulated by using a <i>split
    </i>. When you press the <b>Enter</b> key, Vex attempts to make two 
    copies of the current element, splitting the element content 
    between the two. Pressing <b>Enter</b> at the end of a paragraph 
    results in a new, empty paragraph, just as in a word processor.</p>
    <p>A related concept is a <i>join</i>, where two elements of the 
    same type are joined together into one. You join two elements (such 
    as two paragraphs) by placing the caret near the boundary of the 
    elements and pressing <b>Backspace</b> or <b>Delete</b>.</p>
