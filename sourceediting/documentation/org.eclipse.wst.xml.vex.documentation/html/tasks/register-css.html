    <h1>Registering a CSS Stylesheet</h1>

    <p>Vex uses a CSS stylesheet to determine the fonts, colours, and 
    spacing to use while editing your document. You can register a new 
    CSS stylesheet with Vex as follows.</p>

    <ol>

      <li>If necessary, <a href="create-plugin-project.html">create a 
      plug-in project</a> to contain your stylesheet.</li>

      <li>Copy the CSS file and any related files to a directory in the 
      plug-in project. If you copy these files outside of Eclipse, you 
      may have to refresh the workspace in Eclipse by right-clicking 
      the project in the Navigator and selecting <b>Refresh</b> from 
      the context menu.</li>

      <li>In the Navigator, right-click the CSS file and select 
      <b>Properties</b>.</li>

      <li>Select the Vex Style property page and provide a Name for 
      your stylesheet. You must also select all document types to which 
      the style applies. Click OK when done.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>You can confirm that your DTD file was successfully registered 
    by checking out the <a href="show-configuration-view.html">Vex 
    Configuration view</a>.</p>
